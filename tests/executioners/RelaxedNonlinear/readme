Rather than basing convergence on the other application's residual norm, you can just set nl_rel_tol = 0.1. Then let Picard_rel/abs_tol take care of convergence. To ensure that both are converged use ResidualBalanceTransient executioner.
Later we should create an executioner that only needs the other application's final residual in order to judge convergence. But for now ResidualBalance works fine.
